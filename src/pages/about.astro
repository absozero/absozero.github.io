				<h2>
					My Story
				</h2>
				<p>
					I am a computer scientist, devops engineer, sys atemdministrator, and web developer all rolled up into one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's my story, I came from learning to make videos on Imovie, then transferred to editing videos on my computer.
					In the process, I learned about FOSS and its theories doing this, and transferred to a computer-based ecosystem. I soon
					got into multimedia creation, using open source, and even bought a drawing tablet that I still use to help me with this.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, I became more interested in the actual code and underlying technology behind the applications that I was using, and therefore
					began learning the process of how to code. I then used my knowledge of programming to further my knowledge and explore relative areas to
					programming, such as Devops and Containerized development. From there, I used those technologies to further improve and work on my coding.  
				</p>
				<h2>
					My Proficiencies
				</h2>
				<p>
					I mainly work on devops and containerized workflows where isolation and cross-platform workflows are important. I also run a selfhosted server at home and use it 
					to continually learn new technologies.
