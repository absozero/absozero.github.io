Find the code [here](https://github.com/CSXL/solus)

This app was built in order to serve the needs of creating an end-to-end product with a detailed spec from the programmer. This would allow a language model to process and return relative information to create the code for the app spec given.

Solus is a new and experimental technology, and using it at the current point in time may be buggy, but the developers are working on releasing their MVP for this app.

This new tech is exciting, and I can't wait to explore it once a stable version has been released!
