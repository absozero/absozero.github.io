My old portfolio was a fork of a portfolio made by another github user, meant to replicate a Macos environment, and while this was good and worked for a long time, the dependencies went out of date. So, I scrapped the whole thing and rebuilt my portfolio with Astro, which is what you are seeing now.


Though the portfolio will be under maintainence and will be continually updated with my endeavours, the primary development on the site is done before the first deployment, and the remaining will be bugfixes, feature additions, and content additions and updates.
