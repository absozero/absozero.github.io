I rewrote my blog using the hexo framework, because it runs on node, therefore it can work on windows, and I found it much easier to set up and use than the previous framework I used for my blog, which was jekyll, which was inconsistent for me across multiple operating systems.

Now, it feels smoother and almost replicates an experience similar to that of [Dev.to](https://dev.to)

It's live right notw, so you should go and check it out [here](https://absozero.github.io/blog)!
